# ACO Protocol source code
## Protocol Introduction

ACO is a decentralized non-custodial options protocol built on top of Ethereum that allows users to mint and exercise call or put options, in a trustless and decentralized manner without having to rely on any third party.

Each option series is integrated through an ACOToken contract, which is ERC20-compliant, making options transferable, fungible, and ready for further DeFi integrations.
